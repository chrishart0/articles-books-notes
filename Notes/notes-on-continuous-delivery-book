## Chapter 1

### **Releasing Software should be easy and quick.**
* Easy because every change has been tested hundreds of times automatically
* Quick because it's as simple as pressing a button and waiting

* No "release candidates"
    * Every commit should lead to a potential release.
* Saving testing for the end of the process leaves you no time to fix most of the bugs
    * "Leaving testing until the end normally means that there is no time to actually fix the bugs, or that only a small proportion of them can be fixed."
* "In software, when something is painful, the way to reduce the pain is to do it more frequently, not less."

* Everything goes in version control, everything
