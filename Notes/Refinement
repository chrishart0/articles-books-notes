# Refinement
Also known as grooming, refinement is what we call the process of going through stories as a team. During refinement the team is ensuring there is shared understanding of the requirements and then estimating the story points. 

It is important that the team has read the stories before refinement starts. The PO should send out the stories ahead of time and the devs should ask questions and get some clarification before hand.

Here is what the [2020 Scrum Guide](https://scrumguides.org/scrum-guide.html#artifacts-productbacklog) has to say about refinement:
> Product Backlog refinement is the act of breaking down and further defining Product Backlog items into smaller more precise items. This is an ongoing activity to add details, such as a description, order, and size. Attributes often vary with the domain of work. 
>
>The Developers who will be doing the work are responsible for the sizing. The Product Owner may influence the Developers by helping them understand and select trade-offs.

### Engagement
It is important to have high engagement from all the team members who attend the session. Here are some tips for increasing engagement. 
* Smaller meetings: the less people on a meeting the more likely each individual is to feel compelled to participate 
* For remote: turn videos on!
  * The individual team members will feel a lot more engaged if they can see each other
  * Facial expressions are an important piece of how humans communicate, without video we lose this

### When is refinement?
Many teams schedule refinement as a separate, regular meeting. It does not have to be this way. While this may be beneficial for new teams, it is not necessary.

Not all team members need to be present to refine a story.
